Short Description:
The purpose of our application is to provide the UBC Wargamers club a database to store their members, games and events. In addition, we provide them with a user-friendly GUI to manage their database and allow their members to view the games and events they have.

Accomplishments:
- Allow user to log in as either an exec or a member
- Allow users to view a list of games or events
- Allow user to view the details of a certain game (publisher, genre, club copies, etc.) or event (description, date, time, location, host, etc.)
- Allow users to search for games given certain search parameters (title, publisher, genre, play time, etc.)
- Allow users to view some interesting statistics related to games, events or members
- Allow execs to add, edit or delete a new game or event

Changes in the Schema:
- Publishers table: remove address and phone number as it was unnecessary information
- Games table: added year published, difficulty, minimum play time and maximum play time as this would be useful information to store
- PublishedBy: moved date published to games table as a game is only first published once, removed requirement for games to have a publisher because in terms of application functionality, this would allow more flexibility for user input if they did not know or care about publisher of a game
- Uses table: removed this table as we realized most of the time the club will not know what games they will bring to an event until the day-of, and that storing this information is not very useful
- HasGenre table: games can have no genres. This makes it easier for user input if they do not wish to enter a genre for a game
